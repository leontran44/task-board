## Description

In this web application, users can input tasks including:

- Title
- Description
- Due date

These tasks appear as 'card' elements and can be organized into three distinct swim lanes:

- To Do
- In Progress
- Done

Users have the flexibility to drag and drop these cards across different lanes as per their preferences. Additionally, the application notifies users with a yellow card if a task is due within 3 days, and with a red card if the task is overdue or due on the same day.
